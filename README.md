# IBM-ML-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-v2
This project was created in my journey earning a intro to ML certification from IBM. It creates a credit card fraud detection program using scikit-learn and snap ML. It also uses the Python API from Snap ML and Pandas. The models used are decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs).
